    "```\n",
    ">>> new_connection = _\n",
    "```\n",

    "to be sure. The first element is a socket - it's a new socket, similar to the ones we used in our chat server.\n",

    "You should see this message show up in the terminal running netcat! You can ave a conversation back and forth - this is a two-way connection. On the Python side you'll need to call `.recv(100)` to see what's come in, just like in the chat client."

    "Write a chat server that you and other people can connect to. The code will be similar to your interactive session, but once someone connects you'll want to receive a message the send then respond. Here are some useful pieces of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `socket.socket()` - still creates a socket\n",
    "* `s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)` - a method on the socket object to call before binding that allows you to rerun your program without waiting about 10 seconds.\n",
    "* `s.bind((ip_address, port))` - describes where to listen. If ip_address is an empty string, this will listen to connections on any network your computer is on. If ip_address is \"localhost\" or \"127.0.0.1\", then only you machine will be able to connect to this socket\n",
    "* `s.listen(5)` tells operating system to start accepting connections (and will accept 5 before telling the sixth no, that it needs to wait until you accept one of the connections first).\n",
    "* `s.accept()` returns a tuple of two elements: the socket that represents the new connection, and some information about where this connetion came from (ip address and port)\n",
