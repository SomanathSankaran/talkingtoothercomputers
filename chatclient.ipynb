    "There's a major issue with the simple version of this chat client: it doesn't check for messages until the user finishes typing a message! This seems like a fundemental limitation of .send() and .recv() as we've learned them: these are both blocking calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's typical for networked applications to need to deal with this kind of concurrency.\n",
    "Solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### use separate programs\n",
    "Imagine one program which only read from the chat server, and another in a separate terminal that allowed the user to type! We already have this somewhat: our nc program is constantly printing, so we could use that plus this chat client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### use threads\n",
    "Let's try the previous idea but in the same program! Threading in Python looks something like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "def thing1():\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        print('hi')\n",
    "        time.sleep(3)\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "t = threading.Thread(target=thing1)\n",
    "t.daemon = True\n",
    "t.start()  # this starts the other thread running, but the main thread continues to the next line\n",
    "\n",
    "while True:  # this code is being run on the main thread as normal\n",
    "    print(input().upper())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### use nonblocking socket\n",
    "You can change the api that a socket will use by making it a nonblocking socket!\n",
    "Now at least when you try to read bytes off of the socket you won't be stuck until some happen, although\n",
    "you will need to catch an exception if there aren't any ready and check again soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = socket.socket()\n",
    "s.connect(('ipaddress', 1234))\n",
    "s.setblocking(False)\n",
    "s.recv(1000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### use select\n",
    "On unix-like operating systems, sockets and the stdin stream are both file desciptors. `select` provides a way to block on multiple things at once, and whichever ones are ready first are returned. A select loop might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
